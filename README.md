# Score-predictions

This is a Data Science project where we can predict the scores of students if you have the no of hours a student studies a day

This project was done using Linear Regression from scikit learn library

its a simple project 
first you have to split the train and test sets
then you have to fit it in the model
after that predict the scores of students using predict method
in training the model you have to give both the scores and hours of study
so in predicting you can give the no of hours to get the score
